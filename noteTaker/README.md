## Main Features

- Full-Text-Search: Efficient full-text search functionality, allowing users to quickly find related notes they have written.
- Asynchronous Processing: Perform independent summarization tasks with lambda functions
- Scalable Design: Handle high-load scenarios by initiating additional containers as needed.
- Infrastructure Management: Employed Terraform for resources management.

### Workflow

- Backend Process: If the tests pass successfully, a Docker image is pushed to a Docker Hub, triggering an update in the AWS ECS services.

- Frontend Process: Every commit initiates a build process for the React application. The resulting static files are uploaded directly to AWS S3 for web hosting, followed by an invalidation of the CloudFront cache.

### Testing

Our project utilizes integration testing, focusing primarily on typical use-cases and critical paths.



### Tools

- GitHub Actions: Automates the workflow from code push to deployment.
- Jest and SuperTest: Utilizes for integrated testing in the backend API.
- Docker: Ensures consistent, reproducible environments for AWS ECS.
- Terraform: Manages and provisions AWS services resources, enhancing scalability and consistency.
